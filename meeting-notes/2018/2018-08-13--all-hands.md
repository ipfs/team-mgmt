## Agenda

_General discussions, decisions, etc._

-   @lidel, 5min update on migration towards base32 CIDv1

    -   Meta-issue:<https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs/issues/337> 

        -   go-ipfs:<https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/5358> 
        -   js-ipfs:<https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/1440> 

    -   To have a universal identifier
    -   Touches lots of modules in our eco-system
    -   @kevina lead on go-ipfs

        -   APIs to change base encoding on input or output

    -   Js-ipfs follows the changes that are done on the Go side
    -   Work is kind of blocked on the Go side, please give feedback on the main Go issue (especially @stebalien, @whyrusleeping)!
    -   Questions:

        -   Which base32 encoding?

            -   Answer: current work is not centered around which encoding, but that custom encoding are possible

-   @victor, 5min, report on live stream + small demo

    -   <https://github.com/VictorBjelkholm/self-editing-website>
    -   <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ud7WXPCxHyc>
    -   Short demo of what it does:<https://youtu.be/ud7WXPCxHyc?t=3h12m22s> 
    -   Some numbers:<https://imgur.com/a/BxdsTic> 
    -   Demo is an editor that can edit itself
    -   Livestream took 5h, quite some viewers (see link above)
    -   Questions:

        -   How do you send the changes?

            -   Only got so far as publishing the current filename + contents hash over pubsub, nothing on the receiving end
            -   After the stream, got the idea of running a git implementation in the browser together with the application, to allow “true” patches instead
            -   <https://github.com/isomorphic-git/isomorphic-git> fits the bill for git in the browser and just needs a IPFS backend in BrowserFS to work together with IPFS, which seemed easy enough https&#x3A;//github.com/jvilk/BrowserFS/issues/203

-   @victor, 5min, ipfs/testing cleanup

    -   Issue templates / labels / repository unification
    -   <https://github.com/ipfs/testing>
    -   Everything that touches testing infra now lives in this repository (e.g. Jenkins)

-   @flyingzumwalt, 5min, check in about new format for these calls

    -   <https://github.com/ipfs/pm/issues/636> 
    -   @flyingzumwalt is looking for people helping making the new format actually happen
    -   @mikeal doesn’t have the bandwidth atm, but next month
    -   New format is postponed till next month


## Demos

_Show your work!_

-   @achingbrain, npm-on-ipfs

    -   Use IFPS as registry
    -   Downloads from npm and caches in IPFS
    -   Great to find bugs/perf issues in our implementation
    -   Questions

        -   What are the benefits?

            -   Data still there if npm goes down
            -   You can work offline
            -   Full mirror is too huge, so you can have a mirror of the subset you really use
