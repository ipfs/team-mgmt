        - in 1-2 hours jenkins will be offline 
    - Question: what is the progress migrating everything to jenkins
        - currently focusing on performance issues first
        - some travis specific hitches that need to be figured out
    - Question: is there a way to prioritize getting jenkins to highest use repos?
        - can do!
- @IPFS key management (@richardschneider)
    - @whyrusleeping suggested 4 ipfs commands to support key management
    - specifically trying to get pkcs support
    - Question: what can we do to help?   any blockers?
        - How to acutally exchange the keys in a distributed environment when peers might be offline?
        - @whyrusleeping, fine to assume both peers are online before exchanging.  Open a libp2p stream between peers and transfer.
        - Maybe parts of this (the exchange) should be generalized?  Maybe the bigger issue is enabling peers to directly exchange information.
        - @whyrusleeping, there are ways to do this `host.newstream(pid)`
        - @daviddias what is missing is encryption at rest, i.e. encrypt so that only the peer receiving can decrypt.  We should make sure we are precisely targetting your use case.
    - some discussion on node forge, libp2p crypto
    - github.com/jonnycrunch/ipid DID (decentralized/distributed identifiers for PKI) spec built on ipfs
