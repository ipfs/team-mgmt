## Agenda

https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/milestones

https://waffle.io/ipfs/go-ipfs

Not much happened this week. 
Newest thing is the pubsub implementation. We hope for this to be our first, official impl. 

### IPLD

From the IPLD milestone: We recently merged the CID changes. Right now, we are waiting for refining the go-ipld stack. 

### Releases

Made some release candidates for go-ipfs. Might be holding off on these while @why is in Shanghai. If you're still using 0.4.2, upgrade to 0.4.3 and 0.4.4-rc. Works better, uses much less __, connectivity changes are good. Or, wait for the release. 

### Movement issues

"Cleaning up multiformats and libp2p move mess" - https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/3237

### Open PRs

There are a lot of open PRs. Some of them are in progress, some of them are waiting for author. Basically, some are blocked. A lot of these are in the "In Progress" column; it would be good to break up blocked PRs and put them elsewhere, maybe.

Waffle, by default, puts PRs "In Progress". That's not right.

## Actionables

- [ ] @flyingzumwalt: Write up a summary of this discussion

**You have 30 minutes for this agenda**, 5 minutes before the meeting ends, consider moving the remaining items to a github discussion thread so that all the other sprint meetings can start in time.
