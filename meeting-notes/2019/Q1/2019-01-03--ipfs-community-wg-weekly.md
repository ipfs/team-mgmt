- @NukeManDan offered to start a ProtoSchool chapter in Denver!
-  Notes from discussion of Q1 OKRs:
    -   Medium publication (led by Teri)
        -   Possibly “The Protocol” but open to other name suggestions
        -   Format can include embedded podcasts, videos, code, etc.
        -   Place to highlight use cases, awesome dapps people have built, etc
        -   Focused not just on IPFS but also other decentralized web topics and projects
    -   Working on ready event in js-ifps API (Mikeal / Portia)

**Action Items** (_Announce issues that need help, get people to help_)
-   If you’d like to lead a ProtoSchool chapter, head to the [website](https://proto.school) and look for setup instructions. Let Teri know if the instructions aren’t clear! It would be great to have as many chapters as possible before the public launch on the January 14.
-   Feedback on all aspects of ProtoSchool is welcome as we work to fine tune the site for public launch. Feel free to log issues with your questions and suggestions.
