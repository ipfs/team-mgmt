    -   Organizing another meetup and is doing an overview of different protocols while highlighting the benefits of IPFS. Interested in collaborating with @jimpick

-   @jimpick

    -   Working on pinning backend for Peer Pad. Having trouble using IPLD to store the backup snapshots, not exactly sure which api to use. Was not obvious from the documentation which API to use (i.e. mfs, cid, and file add)
    -   Would like a webinar on creating a Dapp using IPFS and also requested a video that goes over basic IPFS CLI command.
