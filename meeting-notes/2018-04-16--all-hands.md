## Notes

 - IPFS Companion:
   - https://blog.ipfs.io/35-ipfs-companion-2-2-0/
   - Is now on the stable channel for Chrome and Firefox
   - Browser embedded JS peer or locally installed peer
   - Help wanted for security issue: https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/issues/454
       - One problem is that `window.ipfs` leaks. People will know you have IPFS Companion installed
       - UX for the access stuff

 - Q: What's the current state of security and audits
     - Auditing will be done once stable. Currently it's more about getting things work

 - go-ipfs on Windows
     - GH issue for tracking: https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/4808
     - Console output was scrabled, it's not anymore
     - Building is way smoother now
         - gx needs still needs a few fixes
     - In e.g. China there's a problem with building due to golang.org and ipfs.io being blocked
         - The plan is to have proper tarballs so it can be installed without connectivity once you have the tarball
     - There were problems with filenames on various filesystems. The filenames are now sanatized.
     - stdio for piping things in and out now works
     - Detailed blog post is coming
     - Q: Have you looked into JS-IPFS on Windows, if the fixes are needed there as well?
         - It wasn't taken a closer look
         - Though Richard puts a lot of work in making sure the JS stuff works on Windows
         - Path sanatizing might be a good candidate for making sure it works the same on all platforms and implementations

 - The pipeline to publish a blog post is quite heavy
     - Should be improved. For now open a PR and we'll go from there
