## Notes

### Roadmap

New Roadmap for libp2p. Link: https://github.com/libp2p/libp2p/pull/2.
If you have comments, share them. 
We're in the middle of the 2nd. 
First milestone is interop. @whyrusleeping is doing the recipes for adding CI for js-p2p against go-p2p tests. 
Second milestone is more work for @whyrusleeping, about connectivity for go-p2p and js-ipfs. Still need to have a proper discussion about how to move forward. @why is in charge of bringing this up next time. 

### Website

- @RichardLitt's domain. Has he had time? No. Would be good to have something up. 
- @RichardLitt made minimalcayman.com for multiformats/website and ipld/website. Would be good to use this, or something similar, for libp2p. 

#### IPNS tool

@lgierth made a pages tool so that @Richardlitt can deploy immediately. Will work with @RichardLitt on it. 

### PubSub testnet

- @Gavin unexpected travel last week, should have something up middle of this week. Not blocked on anything, will need feedback tuesday // Wednesday-ish. Move from there. 

### HalfClosed conn upgrade.

- @diasDavid started, then got pulled into the pull-stream stuff. Needs to work on it. 

### CI Coverage

- Someone needs to go through and enable CI for all of the repos. 

### Other

@jbenet is looking thoughtful at his screen. 

@dig: Due to finally dealing with streams, we will be able to merge secio with libp2p. We can do that, but we should test that it works with go-ipfs before shipping. 
@diasdavid: We have some tests that we can do right now, that don't use Secio. So, I asked @why to help with this. We can test with the scripts he is making soon. 
Let's see if they are ready tomorrow or not, and let's make sure they are ready by wednesday. If things fail at Wednesday, we have to recalculate. 
@dig: I am expectnig our home-grown secio will have some bugs, so there will be some fixing there. 

### New People

Dive in! Read the Captain.log! Check out the issues! Ping @diasdavid or anyone else! There is stuff to do! Write more tests! 

## Actionables

- [ ] @all Take a look at the new Roadmap and share your thoughts. https://github.com/libp2p/libp2p/pull/2
- [ ] @RichardLitt will stub out the website // design by EOD Tuesday
- [ ] @diasdavid and @richard chat tuesday, make a roadmap for libp2p.io
- [ ] @lgierth and @RichardLitt work on IPNS tool for launching ipld.io or similar on Monday late day.
- [ ] @gavinmcdermott to work on the pubsub-testnet this week, will ping @diasdavid for feedback
- [ ] @jbenet, @em-ly, @flyingzumwalt: Please read the waffle board and check the roadmap. I know you're working on the go-ipfs board right now, but would be cool if we could have the new PM process here, too. Particularly: From your expectations of the roadmap, what is missing, what is not clear, what was overlooked in Lisbon, etc. For example, the libp2p roadmap doesn't include anything pubsub related. Tell @diasdavid what you want to have there, and if it is good to go. Just thumbs up for now, whatever you have. 
- [ ] @diasdavid: surface the PM mechanics as soon as possible. 

##### After sprint meeting is finished, create the respective action items on the Github sprint issue
