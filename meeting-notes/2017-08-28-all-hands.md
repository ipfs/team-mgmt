### Demos

#### Brave Extension (@diasdavid)

- Q: @flyingzumwalt: what is the state of js-ipfs in electron apps? 
- It's getting questions in:
	- https://discuss.ipfs.io/t/ipfs-station-electron-app/1021/2
	- https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/843
- A: @diasdavid: 
  - js-ipfs on the renderer content works (like on a webpage).
  - js-ipfs on the main process currently doesn't work because of native dependencies used by js-ipfs. Need to figure out how to rebuild them such that they match the v8 version of electron.
  - possible solution: run go-ipfs and use js-ipfs-api to communicate with it from the main process
